/*
large data set of an area with income and number of people having that income. 
You want to create an efficient search system using Binary Search Tree (BST) to search an income and related count.

Input to be read from in.txt file

Output: display the result in console

Tasks:
Create a binary search tree based on the income as the key. 
However, you should also store the corresponding count within the BST node.
Print the data in the tree in the in-order traversal 
to see the keys are in sorted order. 
Print them like comma separated tuple (income, count), (income, count), â€¦.                       
Write a function that prints all the incomes with odd number of people count.
Write a function to find the total number of people 
having the highest income from your tree.
